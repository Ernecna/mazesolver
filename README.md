Maze Solver in Java
Overview
This Java program is designed to solve mazes or similar path-finding problems. It utilizes algorithms and data structures for efficiently finding a path through a maze.

File Description
mazesolver.java
Purpose: Implements a maze-solving algorithm.
Functionality:
The program likely includes a class that represents the maze solver.
It manages data structures such as graphs or adjacency lists for representing the maze.
The solver possibly uses graph traversal techniques like depth-first search or breadth-first search to find a path through the maze.
The program may also include methods to read maze data, initialize the maze representation, and display the solved path.
Getting Started
To run this maze solver, compile mazesolver.java and execute it. The program might require an input maze structure, either through file input or hardcoded data, to demonstrate its solving capabilities.
